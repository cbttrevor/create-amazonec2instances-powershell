## Learning Objectives

* PowerShell is an object-oriented, cross-platform automation language from Microsoft
* PowerShell was made cross-platform and open source in August 2016
* Cross-platform .NET Core, which PowerShell is built on top of, made this possible
* PowerShell is a fully fledged programming language, that makes prototyping easy
* One of the reasons I love PowerShell the most is because it's both interactive and useful for programming

* AWS provides an SDK for PowerShell that wraps their REST APIs for all AWS services
